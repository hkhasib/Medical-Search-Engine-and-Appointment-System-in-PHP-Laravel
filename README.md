# Medical Search Engine & Appointment System in PHP Laravel</h1>

This a project based on Laravel 8 and compatible with PHP 8. Here, Users can search for doctors by using name, designation, disease name and symtoms. This project may help the beginners to understand some basics of Laravel as well as unlock some new ideas.

## About Medical Search Engine & Appointment System

This is a Doctor Search Engine & Appointment System built using laravel or PHP. Currently, The initial version has the following features:

- Search Any Doctors by Name, Clinic, Disease Name or Your Symptoms
- Book Appointment by choosing from Available Schedules
- Signup for Patient/Business/Doctor Accounts AnyTime
- Central Admin can Add Supported Locations (Countries, States, Cities, Zones, Areas, etc.)
- Doctor's Routine Maker
- Add Clinic and Departments
- Add Doctors to the Departments
- Add Front-Desk Users
- View States in Dashboard
- Prescription Manager
- And Many More

## Technologies I have used in this Project
This Doctors Search Engine+Appointment System has been built with these technologies.
- PHP as Backend Programming Language
- Vanilla Javscript, Jquery
- Laravel as Backend Framework and VueJS for a small part (test purpose) as front-end framework
- HTML, CSS, Bootsrap
- MySQL for DB

## Limitations
Right now, this project is incomplete (80% done and usable). But, You can use it and most functions are usable. Only location based search result functions have not been implemented.
Also, I have not used default or standard Authentication methods and default Laravel Eloquent Relationships. So, For relations, I have mostly used Join function of SQL. In future, I may change it to make it easier.

## Warning:
You should know that the templates I have used is premium one from Envato Market. So, Be careful before using it specially for commercial purpose.

## How to Run this Project
Running this project is very easy. To do it, you can follow these steps.

- Make Sure You Have Installed Composer on Your System
- Then, Download this project and open it with any editor.
- Now, type composer update in the terminal and hit enter. If your editor doesn't have built in terminal, you can use default terminal of your OS.
- Rename the .env.example to .env and put your database details here.
- Then run this command "php artisan migrate" and then, this one "php artisan db:seed"
- Now, You can run your project from local host. However, You also can use this command "php artisan serv" to test this project.
- The default username is "admin" and password is "123456". Use this credential to login and start configuring.
- You should add country, states, cities, zones, areas before adding new users (doctors, front-desk, business).
- Then, Create Clinics and Departments. Put the keywords for departments wisely as these will be used in search engine of this system.
- Then, Add Some Doctor Users and add them to the appropriate clinic's departments.
- Patient can now search and book for appointment.
- Make sure doctors have created their routines using routine maker otherwise no booking will work.

You can modify/customize this project. I hope this project will help to understand how to build a custom link shortening application with Laravel.
